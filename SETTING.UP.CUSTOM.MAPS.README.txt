By default, ReadyUp does not automatically enable on any map.
Flexibility was the key design, and as a result, campaign (and general map) support is not hard-coded.

Campaign and Map support is defined in: CONFIGS/READYUP/MAPLIST.CFG

The map order defined in the config will also double up as a map rotation.


If a campaign or map is not listed in the config, when the level boots up, Ready Up and any module(s) installed will not function.
I have added all officially supported Valve maps (L4D1, L4D2, and Cold Stream) to the map list, along with many of the survival maps.


PLUGINS USING CUSTOM MAPNAME.CFG FILES

Sometimes plugins will require a custom mapname.cfg to function, such as RUM_NoRush, which uses configs found in: CONFIGS/READYUP/NORUSH/
There must be a config matching the name of the current map, or the plugin will unload. By default, I've included all maps that are packaged with
Left 4 Dead 2. For custom maps, you'll need to add a config for each one.
