\___________________/

The Ready Up! RPG module is extremely flexible, allowing for an astounding array of talents through ability
combinations. With this flexibility comes the freedom to structure each menu in your own, unique way.
From the order of talents, the name of the talents, the abilities of each talent, and more!

This also means that the configuration required for this module is much more demanding. As opposed to mods that
are hard-coded, RPG reads the data inserted into files. It'll take longer to set up, but it'll also be easier to
edit and make changes and/or additions on the fly.

Don't worry about the effects of removing or adding options. New database entries are automatically created at
this time; However, if the column already exists, it will log the error, but don't worry about that right now.
At some point, when other features have been implemented, I'll take the time to re-work this method.


The samples below show how to properly configure each file.
THE ACCEPTABLE KEYS MAY CHANGE BETWEEN NOW AND THE FINAL WORKING VERSION OF THE MODULE.


../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/CONFIG.CFG
This is RPG's main config file. It sets the database name for the server it's attached to, as well as things like
"priority save" to determine if infected bot data is saved on that server or not. For that, specifically, only one
server should be saving infected bot data, because otherwise the servers will simply take turns overwriting each other.
Other things that aren't module specific, such as experience requirements and the number of upgrades players may purchase
for talents each level, are also included here.


../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/MAINMENU.CFG
This is the main menu. Translation name (case-sensitive) goes on the left, in the "key" column, while the actual
config file it references goes on the right, in the "value" column. You can use config files multiple times, since
you can define in these specific config files which "key" column they actually show up in, defined in the talent
through the "part of menu named?" key. Again, these are CASE-SENSITIVE.
You do not set in this config whether or not players can see specific menus, instead, for menus that can be restricted
based on specific flags, see the main config.cfg.


../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/EVENTS.CFG
Please refer to the full list of events, located here: http://wiki.alliedmods.net/Left_4_Dead_2_Events
All keys and values from the events listed on the site aren't required. However, as of this version (2.x) update, I
believe that I've added most of the useful events to the game. If you want to use an event that is not supported,
please post a request on the issues section of http://github.com/exskye in detail.


../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/SURVIVORMENU.CFG
or
../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/INFECTEDMENU.CFG
These config files handle the talents that show up for players.
You can have as many categories as you want, just remember to, again, create translation files for them. You must
also place them in the MAINMENU.cfg
All talents must also have their section name entered into the translation file.
Setting up talents can take a lot of time, especially if this is your first attempt at using RPG. Refer to the default
talents that I have created. If you decide you want to use them, but don't like the name, the great thing about RPG is
it's pretty modular, so you can change the name! But, again, remember to *also* change the translation name.
NOTE: the name of the talents in the talent menus will also be their names in the database, so changing the name after
players have started to level is NOT recommended, because it will NOT transfer their data to the new column.


../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/CHATSETTINGS.CFG
This config works in CONJUNCTION WITH SMLIB, a required library for RPG. The version that I used and tested is included
but it is strongly recommended that you keep up to date with the author version.
Spectators are automatically coloured gray, but will retain their level display.
Chat settings can be restricted to players with the z and a flags (I will add flag customization in an update) in the CONFIG.cfg
through the "all players chat settings?" key/value. Currently, I've included all possible chat colours in the config, but you can
obviously remove as you see fit.


../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/POINTS.CFG
This config handles the "buy menu" where players can spend point(s) that they've earned in-game on temporary items that last until
the round ends. In this version of RPG, the point(s) earned DO NOT CARRY OVER BETWEEN ROUNDS. There is NO OPTION for them to, and I
do not plan on adding an option like that. The points module is one of the ways for lower-level players to have an even ground with
higher level players, with all players starting the round at 0.0 point(s). If players retained point(s) between rounds, this balance
would be thrown off. We use float values, because players can earn PARTIAL points towards their total.
The most important ways to earn points are through DAMAGING (not killing) players on the opposing team, as well as healing teammates.
Healing teammates awards the player you heal point(s) and experience, which encourages players to assist each other, instead of hoard
supplies for themselves. Flat out killing a player doesn't net you bonus experience, but rather, the raw damage you dealt is how the
experience is determined.
WHEN EXPERIENCE AND POINTS FOR DAMAGE IS AWARDED:
When an Infected player dies, anyone the player damaged or was damaged by receives experience (and point(s)) for their contributions.
Even players who have died will earn their contribution experience and point(s).

NOTE:
SOME POINT MENU ITEMS CAN BE MAP OR CONDITION SPECIFIC, SUCH AS MELEE WEAPONS AND RESPAWN. SEE THEIR APPROPRIATE SECTIONS IN THE POINTS.CFG
ON THE EXAMPLES THAT I HAVE CREATED.


../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/GATHERQUESTS.CFG
As of patch 2.0.1, gather quests have not been integrated, yet. The goal is to hav them integrated by 2.1, along with Runes, which are
currently in-development. Gather quests will simply be... "Collect x hunter arms" and, each time you kill a hunter, you'll have a CHANCE
to collect between y and z hunter arms. Finishing the quest will reward experience, point(s), and other bonuses.


../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/RUNES.CFG
As of patch 2.0.1, runes have not been integrated, yet. This is the patch that I am currently working on, and plan to have it integrated by
2.1 at the latest. Runes are powerful items that follow the yin/yang tradition; their power will always come at a great price. Instead of
spending experience on leveling up or upgrading talents, you can spend it to upgrade your rune level, making your rune more powerful.
Runes can require more experience than you can currently hold in order to level up. To level up runes under that condition, you'll have to
level up until you can carry enough experience required to upgrade it.
*NOTE: YOU MUST DESTROY THE RUNE YOU ARE CARRYING BEFORE YOU CAN PICK UP A NEW ONE, AND DOING SO WILL RESET YOUR RUNE LEVEL TO 0, EFFECTIVELY
LOSING ALL EXPERIENCE YOU'VE SPENT ON THAT RUNE. PICKING UP THE SAME RUNE WILL NOT MAINTAIN THE RUNE LEVEL, EITHER. AS A RESULT, YOU MUST
WEIGH THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR CURRENT RUNE VERSUS A POTENTIALLY BETTER (OR WORSE) RUNE FOR YOUR PURPOSES.
**NOTE: An inventory system will be introduced, potentially in patch 2.1, or later, which allows players to hold additional runes, and possibly
other items. Included with that update will be the option (in the main CONFIG.CFG) to restrict inventory access to users with specific flags, only.


../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/STORE.CFG
The store is where players spend their store points; You can config store points to be anything you want them to be, like a representation of
your server, and something completely unique. Like in other configs, you must create translation entries for all section names. There is a limit
to what can and cannot be included here, based on the ITEM EFFECT, but if there's something you'd like added that you don't see, please open an
issue on http://github.com/exskye with a very detailed description of what you are looking for.


../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/TRAILS.CFG
This config lets you set the weapon trail colours for players. Currently, it's specific to their character model, and can be toggled in the main
CONFIG.CFG file. In a later patch, presumably BEFORE 2.1, I plan on adding the option for players to manually set their colours, or allowing them
to be the defaults set in this config. The option to disable them exists, in case you want to use a different plugin to handle trails.


../CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/WEAPON_LEVELS.CFG
This module was removed in 1.9x. However, if you would like to see it remade from the ground up and integrated, again, let me know.
Essentially, weapon levels increased the potential damage of a players weapon. It then compares the weapon level to the target level of
the player the survivor is shooting, to determine the percentage of bonus damage from the weapon level, goes through. It can be as low as NO BONUS
or as high as is set in the main CONFIG.CFG.
NOTE: Weapon levels can be restricted in the main CONFIG.CFG which means it can be set so players can only level a weapon a certain amount of levels
above their actual level, if you want to encourage them to level multiple categories.
