// For each of the KEYs (left side) create a TRANSLATIONS FILE ENTRY.
// Editing the keys or values in this file, other than simply reordering, could potentially
// cause the plugin to stop functioning or produce errors that I will not troubleshoot.
// Please refer to your better judgement before editing.

// Possible config options are: rpg/survivormenu.cfg or rpg/infectedmenu.cfg.
// Talents use the "part of menu named?" key which refers to the left column names to determine
// which sub-menu in-game that they appear under.
// You can add as many options as you want, here. It'll simply create multiple pages in the menu.

// For the "rpg/points.cfg" you can also do the same as with the talent options, by specifying in
// that config what loads where. How cool is that :)


// The Main Menu config has been completely restructured!
// This new structure allows me to create new options so that server operators have more flexibility with
// creating their menu's! It also means that server operator's won't necessarily need to edit the config
// just because they want to switch game types!
// New features:

// "config?"	->		Which config does this menu option point to?
// "team?"		->		Which team(s) does this menu display for? 1 (Spectator) 2 (Survivor) 3 (Infected)
// "gamemode?"	->		Which gamemode's are required for this menu to display? 1 (Coop) 2 (Versus) 3 (Survival)
//						Please note that the values reflected are based on the gamemode's as defined in the readyup config.
//						For "Coop" gamemodes, please refer to "coop game modes?" in your readyup.cfg.
//						Any gamemode's not listed in readyup.cfg will result in the menu option not displaying even if
//						it's a variant of the required gamemode.
// "flags?"		->		Are specific flags required to view this menu option? If omitted, flags will be ignored.

// Please Note***
// If a gamemode is active and not supported, if there are variables specific to it, such as with handicaps, it will automatically set that
// players handicap to disabled. This is great if you, for instance, want only survivors to have access to handicap in a versus game environment.
