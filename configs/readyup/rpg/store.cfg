//			THIS CONFIG IS FOR THE STORE COMPONENT.
//			The store component is entirely optional. Just create no options and the store will not show in the menu.
//			If you want the item to be strictly obtainable from the store, set the "common drop chance?" to "0.0"

//			ITEM EFFECT		determines which effect is caused. Some are INSTANT, ONE TIME USE effects.

//			"r"			Lets a player respect all of their talents. They retain their experience, levels, etc., but their talent upgrades are wiped.
//			"s"			The player receives a free SLATE point that they can assign to any category
//			"t"			The player receives a free talent upgrade
//			"x"			Increases experience gain for the set duration. 0.5 for strength means a 50% experience gain.
