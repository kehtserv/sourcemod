// "ability trigger?" values:		(Eventually, these will ALL be user-defined... mwahahaha
//	"A"	-	Infected Abilities, such as hunter pounce or a spitter spitting
//	"a"	-	Triggers when the player spawns
//	"c"	-	Depends on the chance roll ability (Excluding this char from "ability trigger?" means a die won't roll to determine if it fires)
//	"C"	-	Triggers when a survivor kills a common (or uncommon) infected.
//	"D"	-	Damaging a player on the opposite team
//	"d"	-	Damaging a player on the same team. (Abilities like healing bullets)
//	"E"	-	Triggers when the player dies
//	"e"	-	Triggers when the player kills another player.
//	"g"	-	Triggers when the infected player enters ghost mode.
//	"h"	-	This trigger still exists in code but is deprecated here. Don't use it, as it will be removed from code.
//	"i"	-	Triggered when a player tags someone (such as being biled on, grabbed by a smoker, etc. "tag ability?" is the key.
//	"I"	-	Triggered when a player is tagged by someone.
//	"j"	-	Triggered when a player jumps while they DO NOT have an active victim (or while they are not a victim) (Does not trigger if they are not touching the ground.)
//	"J"	-	Triggered when a player jumps while they have an active victim (ex: They're a jockey, riding a survivor, and they press their jump key.)
//	"k"	-	Triggered when a survivor kills an infected player while incapacitated.
//	"l"	-	Damaged by a player on the same team.
//	"L"	-	Damaged by a player on the opposite team.
//	"m"	-	Triggers when a survivor player is incapacitated. The infected player triggers this ability, but if the player who incaps isn't the survivors ensnare (person who has them pounced, etc.) target, the ensnare target can trigger their ability in this way, too.
//	"M"	-	Triggers when (and for) the infected player who has just released a survivor they had ensnared, whether through the survivor dying, or the infected player being forced to stop.
//	"n"	-	Triggers when a survivor player (or a tank (i.e. during tank death animation)) is incapacitated AND for survivors, IF the survivor isn't an infected player's active victim (i.e. not pounced, charged, etc.)
//	"N"	-	Triggers when a survivor player is incapacitated AND currently a victim (i.e. pounced, charged, etc.) of an infected player.
//	"p"	-	Periodic (Timer)
//	"P"	-	Charger Impact
//	"s"	-	Damaged by a player on the opposite team who also has you ensnared (such as a hunter who is currently pounced on you or a charger who is currently pummeling you.)
//	"T"	-	Triggers when spit deals damage
//	"v"	-	Requires having a survivor player as a victim (i.e. having a survivor player pounced.)
//	"V"	-	Requires being an infected players victim
//	"x"	-	When you explode (as a boomer) on a player.
//	"X"	-	When a boomer explodes on you (as a survivor)

//	p NOT YET CODED... Not sure what I'm doing with this one.


// You can now mix abilities that rely on percentages (such as slowing abilities) with abilities that rely on base units! Here's the conversion rates:
// If the talent is in units, Under 100.0 units is value * 0.01, Under 1000.0 is value * 0.001, Under 10000.0 is value * 0.0001
// This means if bean bag is 32.0 units / point and a player has 10 points, it's 320.0 total units, so if I have slowing on there as well, slowing will be 0.32 (320.0 * 0.001) @ 32%


// "survivor ability effects?" and "infected ability effects?" values:
//	"a"	-	Adrenaline
//	"A"	-	Respawn the player where they died (SURVIVOR ONLY)
//	"b"	-	Bean bag effect
//	"B"	-	Blind effect
//	"C"	-	Chance roll ability (So it's only used to determine a players roll chance on abilities triggering)
//	"d"	-	Damage is increased (by ability strength) TEMPORARILY (based on ability time)
//	"D"	-	Damage is increased (by ability strength) TEMPORARILY (based on ability time) for the player and their teammates within the allowed distance.
//	"f"	-	Creates fire on the origin of the player
//	"g"	-	Modifies the player gravity temporarily
//	"h"	-	Heals the player
//	"H"	-	Health modifier
//	"i"	-	Bile (the player is covered in bile as if a boomer biled or exploded on them)

//	"k"	-	Instantly kills the target
//	"l"	-	Makes the player transparent; such as a cloaking device. (The higher the value the more cloaked a player is)
//	"m"	-	Player takes damage based on the value
//	"o"	-	Absorbs damage instead of receiving it (essentially, a shield.)
//	"p"	-	Modifies movement speed
//	"P"	-	Modifies movement speed for the activators team
//	"r"	-	Revives the survivor player, as if someone, well, revived them. SURVIVOR ONLY, obviously.
//	"R"	-	Reflects damage
//	"s"	-	Slowing effect
//	"S"	-	Stagger effect
//	"t"	-	Spit is dropped on the target
