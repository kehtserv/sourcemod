|     Compiling     |
\___________________/

I've gone ahead and structured the GITHUB repository exactly as is needed in order to compile
both ReadyUp and all of its supported modules.

NOTE: I HAVE INCLUDED THE LIBRARIES FOR SMLIB, LEFT4DOWNTOWN, L4D2_DIRECT, AND OTHER REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES
OF THE VERSIONS I USED WHEN DEVELOPING AND COMPILING. HOWEVER, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT YOU USE THE LATEST
VERSION MADE AVAILABLE BY ITS RESPECTED DEVELOPER. IF YOU FIND A VERSION THAT DOES NOT WORK WITH READYUP OR
ANY OF ITS MODULES, SIMPLY REVERT TO THE VERSIONS INCLUDED ON THE REPOSITORY AT: http://github.com/exskye

1.	Extract the contents from the Github repository EXACTLY AS IS. You can create a clone of the repository on
	your local machine or download a ZIP from Github.
2.	readyup.sp REQUIRES parser.sp, along with several files in the \scripting\include folder. For the smoothest
	experience, again, make a mirror image of the \scripting\ folder and its subfolders from the repository.
3.	Drag readyup.sp over the compile.exe.

|      Modules      |
\___________________/

Ready Up is designed to provide custom forwards and natives that can be used by modules, as was its original
design philosophy to be "modular" in design. Modules extend the functionality of the core ready up plugin.
Modules are designated by rum_ at the beginning of their name. This isn't required when writing a module, but
I've done it to make it easier for end users to differentiate between the core and any modules that I write.

Modules require the files within the \scripting\include folder, but do not require readyup.sp or parser.sp
to be present. Compiled modules do require a compiled version of readyup.sp to be present in the \plugins\
directory on the server to function.

|   Installation    |
\___________________/

Required files are placed in identical representations of their required locations server-side.
For example, you would place the \configs\readyup\ files in that folder server-side. If the folder doesn't
exist, create it. If the appropriate files aren't properly placed, the plugin and any installed modules will
throw errors.
I've made the archive folder hierarchy identical to what is required for the plugin and modules to properly
function, for convenience to you.

Edit the readyup.cfg inside the \configs\readyup and make sure you set all of the lines, appropriately.
This config is responsible for setting versus, coop, etc. game modes based on information entered.
Please refer to these values descriptions for more information.

NOTE: READYUP WILL ONLY FUNCTION IF THE FIRST AND LAST MAP OF A CAMPAIGN ARE IN THE MAPLIST.CFG.
Custom maps must be added to the configs/readyup/maplist.cfg manually. If the campaign is not listed in this
config, readyup and any modules installed WILL NOT FUNCTION.

\___________________/

Please refer to the FAQ, as well as the COMPILE and INSTALLATION instruction guides on the Github page.
If your issue is still not found in these files, please open an issue on Github at http://github.com/exskye

When submitting a report please include the following:
1. The sourcemod log file (only the section(s) related to readyup or its modules. I will not sort through log spam to assist you.)
2. Steps you've taken to attempt to resolve the issue.
3. The version of sourcemod you are using.

COMPILATION ERRORS:
Please verify that you have setup your folder as an exact copy of the Github repo. If you have updated the \include\ files, try
reverting to the version(s) on the Github repo. I cannot guarantee that Ready Up or its modules will work properly with the newer
versions of those files.
I have painstakingly tested the repo to verify that compilation works properly. It REQUIRES Sourcemod V1.5+
