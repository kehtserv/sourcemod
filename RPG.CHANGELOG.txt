New updates will be added to this log. Version updates prior to v2.0.1 will not be listed, as they aren't relevant.

v2.1 (In Development)

+	Runes!
	-	Runes add a new, comprehensive system to RPG, allowing players to wield powerful artifacts.
		+	A player may hold only one rune at a time.
		+	Picking up a new, un-identified rune requires dropping the rune you are carrying, if you are carrying a rune.
		+	Picking up a rune resets your Rune Level to 0.
		+	Players spend experience to upgrade Rune Level, in the same way they spend it to upgrade talents and level up.

v2.0.4.1 (November 26, 2014)
+	Added complete customization for user flags.
	-	This adds several new variables to /CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/CONFIG.CFG
		+	"reserve player flags?"
			If a player has ANY of these flags, RPG will consider them to be a reserved player.
			Originally, this was hard-coded to "z" or "a" of which it defaults and can now be changed.
		+	"director talent flags?"
			If a player has ANY of these flags, RPG will grant them access to the director menu.
			This was originally "z" only and the command is determined by "director talent command?"
		+	"give player level flags?"
			If a player has ANY of these flags, they can use the command to give players levels.
			This was originally "z" only and the command is determined by "give level command?"
		+	"give store points flags?"
			If a player has ANY of these flags, they can use the command to give players store points.
			This was originally "z" only and the command is determined by "give store points command?"
	-	Adds a new MANDATORY variable to talent configs; /CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/SURVIVORMENU.CFG and /CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/INFECTEDMENU.CFG
		+	"flags?"
			By default, this variable is set to "none" which disables its feature.
			Otherwise, if flags are set, any player who does NOT have any of the flags will not be able to see OR access the talent.
			This is a great way for server operators to test new talents on PUBLIC servers, while granting the ability to do so to specific people.
			
			NOTE: When updating to v2.0.4.1, server operators will need to replace the talent configs with the ones uploaded with this update
			or manually add the "flags?" key to each talent in both configs. After this update, any talent that doesn't have that keyvalue will
			not show in the menu for anyone.
+	Copyright information, including GNU GPLv3 information added to rum_rpg.sp

v2.0.4 (November 26, 2014)

+	Added support for "legacy" item rolls, reflecting the method that I used in SkyRPG3.
	-	Two new variables supporting this feature in the /CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/CONFIG.CFG
		+	"required damage percent for legacy roll?"
			The percentage of a SI max health required for a player to be considered for a legacy item roll.
			Careful here, because it can stop a player from hitting the SI with a single bullet from being eligible.
		+	"legacy item drops?"
			If enabled, item drops operate like they did in skyrpg3, where, if an item drop is determined to happen, any survivor
			who damaged the SI in question rolls a die, and a player is automatically awarded over chat.
+	Added support for server operators to opt in/out of allowing items listed in the in-game store to be included in random
	world drop chance, as well as end of map (EOM) rolls.
	-	New variable added for each option in the /CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/STORE.CFG
		+	"store purchase only?"
			If enabled, the item can ONLY be obtained through a purchase through the store (and as a result, not through world
			drops or end of map rolls)
+	Miscellaneous Updates
	-	Added some comments in code explaining functions and other things the code is doing.
	-	Begun restructuring of main RPG.SP code, for stability and memory efficiency.
	
	NOTE: The rum_rpg.phrases.txt translations file has been updated with several new translations in this update.
	
v2.0.3.1 (Hotfix)

+	Updated Talent Ability Effect: k (Kill target player)
	-	When this ability effect is triggered, any experience and points earned will be properly awarded to players.
+	Updated Talent Ability Effect: B (Blind target player)
	-	Players who die before this ability expires will no longer suffer its effects until the end of the current round.

v2.0.3

+	Added additional keys for talent configs.
	-	"weapons permitted?" key added.
		+	setting the value to "ignore" or "all" will ignore this key.
		+	infected players will automatically ignore this key; it exists for survivors only.
		+	weapons are not case-sensitive, but due to Sourcemod String Length restrictions, there is a limit to how many
			weapons you can allow for each talent.
			-	Example: "weapons permitted?"	"weapon_rifle_ak47weapon_rifle_sg552"
			A talent with this designation would allow the standard m16 (because it is weapon_rifle) as well as the ak47 and sg552
			If any other weapon is used and the player is a survivor, the talent will have no chance of triggering.
	-	"weapons permitted strict?" key added.
		+	the same rules above apply, except:
			-	only one weapon can be defined, here, and it must be an exact match to the weapon name.
			-	Example: "weapons permitted strict?"	"weapon_rifle_ak47"
			A talent with this designation will only trigger if the player is using an ak47.
		+	this key OVERRIDES the "weapons permitted?" key, if it is not set to "ignore"

v2.0.2

+	Melee Weapon Support added to the POINTS module
	-	Added a melee weapons menu with the fireaxe and cricket bat as examples.
	-	Melee weapons can be designated CAMPAIGN SPECIFIC:
		+	If NOT playing on an allowed campaign, the melee option will NOT APPEAR in the menu.
		+	As of this update, RPG now requires ReadyUp v6.0.1, which adds support for querying the current campaign.

v2.0.1

+	Teamwork Awards
	-	Experience bonuses are awarded to players for team-based damage distribution against special infected.
	-	A player must deal a minimum percentage of damage for consideration.
	-	There is a maximum amount that will be considered to discourage lone-wolfing, but the player will still
		earn full base experience for any damage dealt.
	-	A bonus is awarded to each player, based on the number of qualifying participants.
	
+	Discourage Rushing, Encourage Teamwork
	-	Proximity bonuses and penalties to experience gain and damage dealt have been added, based on the number
		of qualifying teammates nearby.
	-	Lone-wolving (e.g. Rushing, abandoning teammates) will result in doing the standard damage, but earning
		experience (and points) at a severe fraction of what you would if you stayed within range of your teammates.

+	New Chat Layout
	-	Chat layout has been modified in order to allow players with longer names, as well as players who would like
		to use larger custom tags to not have their chat cut off. The new chat style is:
		
		[Developer] (2) Skye
		>> This is an example of the new visual chat style.
