New updates will be added to this log. Version updates prior to v2.0.1 will not be listed, as they aren't relevant.

v2.0.3

+	Added additional keys for talent configs.
	-	"weapons permitted?" key added.
		+	setting the value to "ignore" or "all" will ignore this key.
		+	infected players will automatically ignore this key; it exists for survivors only.
		+	weapons are not case-sensitive, but due to Sourcemod String Length restrictions, there is a limit to how many
			weapons you can allow for each talent.
			-	Example: "weapons permitted?"	"weapon_rifle_ak47weapon_rifle_sg552"
			A talent with this designation would allow the standard m16 (because it is weapon_rifle) as well as the ak47 and sg552
			If any other weapon is used and the player is a survivor, the talent will have no chance of triggering.
	-	"weapons permitted strict?" key added.
		+	the same rules above apply, except:
			-	only one weapon can be defined, here, and it must be an exact match to the weapon name.
			-	Example: "weapons permitted strict?"	"weapon_rifle_ak47"
			A talent with this designation will only trigger if the player is using an ak47.
		+	this key OVERRIDES the "weapons permitted?" key, if it is not set to "ignore"

v2.0.2

+	Melee Weapon Support added to the POINTS module
	-	Added a melee weapons menu with the fireaxe and cricket bat as examples.
	-	Melee weapons can be designated CAMPAIGN SPECIFIC:
		+	If NOT playing on an allowed campaign, the melee option will NOT APPEAR in the menu.
		+	As of this update, RPG now requires ReadyUp v6.0.1, which adds support for querying the current campaign.

v2.0.1

+	Teamwork Awards
	-	Experience bonuses are awarded to players for team-based damage distribution against special infected.
	-	A player must deal a minimum percentage of damage for consideration.
	-	There is a maximum amount that will be considered to discourage lone-wolfing, but the player will still
		earn full base experience for any damage dealt.
	-	A bonus is awarded to each player, based on the number of qualifying participants.
	
+	Discourage Rushing, Encourage Teamwork
	-	Proximity bonuses and penalties to experience gain and damage dealt have been added, based on the number
		of qualifying teammates nearby.
	-	Lone-wolving (e.g. Rushing, abandoning teammates) will result in doing the standard damage, but earning
		experience (and points) at a severe fraction of what you would if you stayed within range of your teammates.

+	New Chat Layout
	-	Chat layout has been modified in order to allow players with longer names, as well as players who would like
		to use larger custom tags to not have their chat cut off. The new chat style is:
