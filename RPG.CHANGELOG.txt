New updates will be added to this log. Version updates prior to v2.0.1 will not be listed, as they aren't relevant.
v3.0.3 (In Development) <- Features Not Yet Implemented
+	Configurable game modes? re: gamemodes.cfg?
	-	Something like...
	"vip mode"
	{
		"required votes?"			"0.3"		// 30% must vote for it to trigger
		"select voter only?"		"1"			// Only a player who voted in favor can be selected.
		"player flag?"				"v"			// The flag assigned to the player; players can have multiple flags assigned. v -> vip.
		"remove flag on death?"		"1"			// The player flag will be removed if the player dies.
		"award requirement?"		"r"			// Requirement for award to be given out. r -> survive the entire round with the flag.
		"teams allowed?"			"2"			// Which team(s) are allowed to vote for this game mode? 2 -> survivor
		"team award?"				"1"			// Is the award given to the team if the gamemode is successful, or to the player? 1 -> team (includes player)
		"award type?"				"x"			// What type of award is given out? x -> experience.
		"award value?"				"0.3"		// Use rounded (1.0, 2.0, etc.) values for non-experience award types. if experience, value * gamemode player round earned total, rounded.
		"weapons allowed?"			"pistol"	// Which weapons can the player using the gamemode use? pistol -> weapons containing pistol, only. Magnums/Pistols. "ALL" ignores this key.
		"EOM"						"EOM"
	}
	(The above is a sample config.)
+	Weapon Level 2.0


v3.0.2 (January 9, 2015) <- Current Release Version
+	Config File additions
	-	Points.cfg has additional options:
		+	"team?"
			A required team can now be set. Multiple teams can be allocated, similar to the MainMenu.cfg key. Players not on one of the teams specified
			will not see this menu option.
		+	"gamemode?"
			A required gamemode can now be set. Multiple gamemode's can be allocated, similar to the MainMenu.cfg key. If the gamemode is not found in the
			list, the menu option will not appear.
		+	"flags?"
			Required user flags. Players are only required to match 1 (one) of the flags in the value, similar to the MainMenu.cfg key. If they do not, the
			menu option will not appear for them. This is great for options that you want restricted to, say, just admins, such as director config menus.
+	Code Restructuring / Rewrite
	-	In continuance with the restructuring and rewrite that I was in the process of when I released v3.0.1, additional source files have been heavily
		modified or rewritten for efficiency and to iron out any wrinkles.
+	Chat Interface
	-	Rewritten how the chat interface works.
		Example:
		(1) Skye
		>> This is a simple test.
		>> I was the last one to type, so it doesn't repeat my name.
		(1) New Player
		>> I'm not the last player to type, so it prints my name to everyone.
		(1) Skye
		>> Interesting.
+	Buy Menu
	-	Melee Purchases
		+	Rewrote code pertaining to the purchase of melee weapons, this time it works (I've tested it)
+	Melee Weapons
	-	In previous versions of RPG, melee weapons were restricted to dealing no damage to special infected, because they would one-hit kill them.
		A new config file, "rpg/melee.cfg" has been created. In this file, server operators dictate which melee weapons they want to deal damage to which
		special infected, as well as how much damage they deal per swing.
		If you don't want a melee weapon to damage a special infected, either omit it from the field, or set its value to 0.0.
		If you don't want a certain special infected to receive damage from melee weapons, simply remove its id from the config.
		+	Witch
			Melee damage will still do nothing to witches. We do want them to be a credible threat after all, right?
	-	New Talent Options
		+	"b"		For the survivor who deals damage to a special infected with a melee weapon.
		+	"B"		For the infected (not commons) who receive damage from a survivor via a melee weapon.
+	Miscellaneous
	-	Fixed several issues causing crashes.
	-	Rested Experience
		If maximum rested experience is "0", Maximum rested experience = the player's current maximum experience container.

v3.0.1 (January 2, 2015)
+	Config File restructuring
	-	Talent Config files have been restructured.
		survivormenu.cfg and infectedmenu.cfg have been merged into a single file: talentmenu.cfg. Using the old config names will no longer work.
		The key "activator class required?" is used to determine which team "owns" each talent, if any; it's possible for both teams to have access to
		a talent, if the value of that key contains values from both teams, such as "01" which would allow both survivors and smokers access.
	-	Main Menu Config has been expanded into individual sections.
		Sections have been added to mainmenu.cfg to allow server operators to dictate under which circumstances each menu option is available.
		Circumstances include things like player team, admin flags, server game types.
+	Chance Multiplier for End of Map Rolls
	-	Added new keyvalue to talentmenu.cfg and store.cfg, allowing server operators to add a modifiable weight to the otherwise static roll variable
		when calculating end of map rolls for players.
		+	"weight multiplier?"
			The value can range from 0.0 to 2.0. The value is hard-coded to 2.0 if a value greater is found in the config.
			1.0 is the default value; a value below 1.0 means a lower weight; less likelihood, with 0.0 having no chance in the item being awarded.
			2.0 doubles the chance that the item will successfully roll and as thus, be rewarded.
		+	Weighted rolls let the server operators decide which items they would like to see awarded more often, without having to reconfigure each
		available roll item on an individual level.
+	Talent Creation / Customization Changes
	-	Survivor Class-Specific talent support.
		+	Added new keyvalue to talentmenu.cfg allowing server operators to create talents that require a specific survivor class to activate.
			-	"survivor required?"
				The value MUST match one of the eight survivor models. If omitted or set to "-1" it will allow any survivor.
				This keyvalue is checked if the survivor is either a victim or attacker.
	-	Cross-Team talent support.
		+	Talents can now be used by players on both teams, depending on a specific setting.
			I have, by default, set talents like this to be placed in "part of menu named?" "Cross-Team Talents"
			-	"activator class required?"
				0 - Survivor, 1 -> 6 + 8 - Infected values. Please see the talentmenu.cfg for a complete listing of which class is assigned to which integer.
				If the value of this key is "01" for instance, Survivors AND Smokers can use the talent. Pretty cool, huh?
+	Code Restructuring / Rewrite
	-	A large amount of code has been scrapped, restructured, and/or rewritten.
		+	Optimized Menus
			Menus have been optimized. I've made it easier to create embedded sub-menu's, using less code. /yay
		+	Optimized General Functionality
			Rewritten a few functions that could potentially be confusing to developers, while optimizing the actual amount of existing code.
+	Global Config Variables (config.cfg) Added
	-	"chat settings flags?"
		Custom allowed flags can now be set in the instance in which chat settings are not available for all players.
		Previously this was hard-coded to the a or z flags only, but now any flags can be set. The default is "az"
		+	This variable is ignored if "all players chat settings?" is set to 1.
+	Additional Store Configurations
	-	Server operators have the option to add additional options to the store.
		+	Bulk Experience / Experience Blocks
			Server operators can add experience blocks, whether a specified amount, or a random value within a specified range.
			-	"amount min?" & "amount max?"
				This store option is accompanied by two new values; these numbers can be between 0.01 (1%) and 1.0 (100%)
				The percentage values dictate the amount (multiplied against a players maximum experience container) of experience
				a player will receive when picking up or purchasing the item.
				For a static value, simply set both numbers equal, or set "amount max?" to 0.0
		+	Backpack Items
			Server operators, should they choose, can allow players to buy a RANDOM backpack drop, which will spawn on them.
			These items are free-for-all; any survivor can grab them. Buy them for yourself, or buy them for friends!
		
v2.0.4.1 (November 26, 2014)
+	Added complete customization for user flags.
	-	This adds several new variables to /CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/CONFIG.CFG
		+	"reserve player flags?"
			If a player has ANY of these flags, RPG will consider them to be a reserved player.
			Originally, this was hard-coded to "z" or "a" of which it defaults and can now be changed.
		+	"director talent flags?"
			If a player has ANY of these flags, RPG will grant them access to the director menu.
			This was originally "z" only and the command is determined by "director talent command?"
		+	"give player level flags?"
			If a player has ANY of these flags, they can use the command to give players levels.
			This was originally "z" only and the command is determined by "give level command?"
		+	"give store points flags?"
			If a player has ANY of these flags, they can use the command to give players store points.
			This was originally "z" only and the command is determined by "give store points command?"
	-	Adds a new MANDATORY variable to talent configs; /CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/SURVIVORMENU.CFG and /CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/INFECTEDMENU.CFG
		+	"flags?"
			By default, this variable is set to "none" which disables its feature.
			Otherwise, if flags are set, any player who does NOT have any of the flags will not be able to see OR access the talent.
			This is a great way for server operators to test new talents on PUBLIC servers, while granting the ability to do so to specific people.
			
			NOTE: When updating to v2.0.4.1, server operators will need to replace the talent configs with the ones uploaded with this update
			or manually add the "flags?" key to each talent in both configs. After this update, any talent that doesn't have that keyvalue will
			not show in the menu for anyone.
+	Corrected an issue related to RPG opening up multiple database connections which may lead to:
	-	Issues related to player data correctly loading / saving.
	-	Issues related to database timeouts.
	
+	Copyright information, including GNU GPLv3 information added to rum_rpg.sp

v2.0.4 (November 26, 2014)

+	Added support for "legacy" item rolls, reflecting the method that I used in SkyRPG3.
	-	Two new variables supporting this feature in the /CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/CONFIG.CFG
		+	"required damage percent for legacy roll?"
			The percentage of a SI max health required for a player to be considered for a legacy item roll.
			Careful here, because it can stop a player from hitting the SI with a single bullet from being eligible.
		+	"legacy item drops?"
			If enabled, item drops operate like they did in skyrpg3, where, if an item drop is determined to happen, any survivor
			who damaged the SI in question rolls a die, and a player is automatically awarded over chat.
+	Added support for server operators to opt in/out of allowing items listed in the in-game store to be included in random
	world drop chance, as well as end of map (EOM) rolls.
	-	New variable added for each option in the /CONFIGS/READYUP/RPG/STORE.CFG
		+	"store purchase only?"
			If enabled, the item can ONLY be obtained through a purchase through the store (and as a result, not through world
			drops or end of map rolls)
+	Miscellaneous Updates
	-	Added some comments in code explaining functions and other things the code is doing.
	-	Begun restructuring of main RPG.SP code, for stability and memory efficiency.
	
	NOTE: The rum_rpg.phrases.txt translations file has been updated with several new translations in this update.
	
v2.0.3.1 (Hotfix)

+	Updated Talent Ability Effect: k (Kill target player)
	-	When this ability effect is triggered, any experience and points earned will be properly awarded to players.
+	Updated Talent Ability Effect: B (Blind target player)
	-	Players who die before this ability expires will no longer suffer its effects until the end of the current round.

v2.0.3

+	Added additional keys for talent configs.
	-	"weapons permitted?" key added.
		+	setting the value to "ignore" or "all" will ignore this key.
		+	infected players will automatically ignore this key; it exists for survivors only.
		+	weapons are not case-sensitive, but due to Sourcemod String Length restrictions, there is a limit to how many
			weapons you can allow for each talent.
			-	Example: "weapons permitted?"	"weapon_rifle_ak47weapon_rifle_sg552"
			A talent with this designation would allow the standard m16 (because it is weapon_rifle) as well as the ak47 and sg552
			If any other weapon is used and the player is a survivor, the talent will have no chance of triggering.
	-	"weapons permitted strict?" key added.
		+	the same rules above apply, except:
			-	only one weapon can be defined, here, and it must be an exact match to the weapon name.
			-	Example: "weapons permitted strict?"	"weapon_rifle_ak47"
			A talent with this designation will only trigger if the player is using an ak47.
		+	this key OVERRIDES the "weapons permitted?" key, if it is not set to "ignore"

v2.0.2

+	Melee Weapon Support added to the POINTS module
	-	Added a melee weapons menu with the fireaxe and cricket bat as examples.
	-	Melee weapons can be designated CAMPAIGN SPECIFIC:
		+	If NOT playing on an allowed campaign, the melee option will NOT APPEAR in the menu.
		+	As of this update, RPG now requires ReadyUp v6.0.1, which adds support for querying the current campaign.

v2.0.1

+	Teamwork Awards
	-	Experience bonuses are awarded to players for team-based damage distribution against special infected.
	-	A player must deal a minimum percentage of damage for consideration.
	-	There is a maximum amount that will be considered to discourage lone-wolfing, but the player will still
		earn full base experience for any damage dealt.
	-	A bonus is awarded to each player, based on the number of qualifying participants.
	
+	Discourage Rushing, Encourage Teamwork
	-	Proximity bonuses and penalties to experience gain and damage dealt have been added, based on the number
		of qualifying teammates nearby.
	-	Lone-wolving (e.g. Rushing, abandoning teammates) will result in doing the standard damage, but earning
		experience (and points) at a severe fraction of what you would if you stayed within range of your teammates.

+	New Chat Layout
	-	Chat layout has been modified in order to allow players with longer names, as well as players who would like
		to use larger custom tags to not have their chat cut off. The new chat style is:
		
		[Developer] (2) Skye
		>> This is an example of the new visual chat style.
