This is a development log for the in-development SkyRPG4. I'll include a changelog during development of all implemented features.
There are two branches being used for this development:
	1.	A development branch
		This version contains features that are in-development, but may or may not be finished.
	2.	A stable branch
		This version contains no in-development features.
		
	The stable branch will be the version uploaded to GitHub; When a development branch is upgraded to a stable branch, it will be uploaded to the
	repository, and then a new development branch will be made from it, to continue implementing featuers.
	
What does this mean for server operators and other developers?
	1.	There won't be unused or commented code in the stable branch.
	2.	Comments explaining what each functions do will be provided, but there will not be line-by-line commentary.
	
What is the aim of SkyRPG4?
	1.	In the previous iteration of SkyRPG [ dubbed Ready Up - RPG ] that I developed, it required several major functionalities from my ReadyUp
		plugin in order to operate, such as parsing files and determing certain points, such as when the round was live, ended, or when it was
		safe to load player data.
		
		In SkyRPG4, the Ready Up dependency has been removed. The needed functions will be properly integrated directly into SkyRPG4. It will depend
		on no other plugins, making it more readily available to a larger server-base.
	2.	More Flexibility.
		In this version, I'm developing even more flexibility for server operators, building upon the foundation I developed in the previous iteration.
		This means more options for how to display and setup data.
